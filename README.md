financial_crisis
================

A multi-platform educational project designed to help explain the financial crisis beginning in 2008.

Background: After 9/11, I set out to research as much as I could to figure out how an event so devastating could have happened. For a couple of years I tracked down every conspiracy theory I could. My conspiracy theory research reached it's natural end when the most extreme conspiracy theorists claimed that the world is run by lizard people from another planet. Ahem.

During that time however, I started seeing bits and pieces of what looked to be a conspiracy, but actually provable. The housing market had been inflating at a great rate annually. It was accepted wisdom that purchasing a house ensured that you could sell it at twice the price within a few years. At the same time, sub-prime mortgages were being sold on a massive scale. Expensive houses were being sold to people whose income didn't match the payment schedules that they were on. 

As I was starting my career I noticed that my 401k fund had different levels of risk strategies that I could invest in. The "conservative" level included bundled sub-prime mortages. How could debt that had little chance of being repaid be considered conservative? 

I read further and discovered that there are different agencies in place that are supposed to keep situations like this from happening. Yet, there was a systematic failure of these agencies to downgrade the credit rating of these funds. It felt like something was amiss.

I kept reading and saw that this couldn't be a mistake. This was a systematic money grab. 

It wasn't until I moved to New York and walked around the financial district that my knowledge on this subject crystallized. The financial industry exists in it's own ecosystem. To say that people within the industry were unaware of the malfeasance happening is laughable. That day I overheard a group of bankers laughing about the amount of other people's money that they had lost. 

This project seeks to explain the causes of the financial crisis of 2008 and corruption within the financial industry.
